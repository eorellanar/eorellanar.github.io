            <p>
                I was born January 2004 and raised in Charlotte NC. After graduating with the class of 2022, I am currently a student at UNCC and studying for a Bachelors in Computer Science with a concentration in Networks and Computer Systems. 
                While my degree and hobby are two completely different areas, they're still both something that I'm truly invested in.

            </figure>
            <p>
                My current vehicle is a 1991 Mazda Miata with a five speed manual transmission. It's a rear wheel drive, meaning that the power comes from the back of the wheels instead of the front like most vehicles.
                Beforehand I had a 1993 Honda Civic, also with a five speed manual transmission that I still regret selling. If you're wondering just how much went into making my Miata the way it is now, let's just say
                I have invested well over $10,000 into it.

                Hi my name is Edgar and this website is dedicated to my precious hobby and car. I am a car fanatic and have the pleasure of 
                owning the cute and popular Mazda Miata. With its convertible top and rear wheel drive setup, it's a car for hot girl summer
                and burning rubber in an empty parking lot. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Not only do I have a remarkable car, I have put blood, sweat and tears in the making it. Yes, I am able to do mechanic work, 
                or dare I say that I am a mechanic. I've been working on cars since I was 17 and can confidently do just about anything on my
                car, and a little less on other vehicles.

                <p>The Tail of the Dragon is considered one of the most dangerous road in Amercia. With 318 curves in 11 miles, this road has taken the lives
                    of many drivers and motorcyclist alike, and it was exactly where my friends and I were at. Here we were at the very top, the halfway point 
                    of the trail enjoying the scenery before taking on the rest of the road. We may or may not have been going over the speed limit the entire way.

                <p>After about a year and a half of owning the car, I had to replacet the clutch on my vehicle. This was the biggest job I had done so far 
                    as it meant that I had to drop the entire transmission outside of the vehicle. Luckily, everything went mostly smoothly and the car
                    is still running and driving (so far).

                <p>After receiving my tax returns two weeks prior, I had the unfortunate event of getting in an accident. While the other car was responsible for causing it (the driver had tried to switch into the lane I was in) I 
                    had to pay it out of pocket. Worst part was, fighting the insurance company would have resulted in a bigger loss than gain.

                <p>
                    When I was 16 back in 2020, my friend had just gotten a 2016 Toyota Corolla S. What made this vehicle so special, was that it came with a six speed manual transmission. I didn't 
                    think much of it until he offered to teach me how to drive it. From that point forward, I had fallen even more in love with driving and became more involved with the car
                    community as a whole. I became fascinated and wanted to become more knowledgable of the automotive field. Thus, prompting me to work at O'Reilly's Auto Parts and later as a 
                    general technician at a local dealership. As time went on, I became more and more skilled mechanically to the point where I even worked on my friends' car. It's safe to say that the 
                    mechanic route is a safe fall back if my Computer Science degree doesn't land me anything.
