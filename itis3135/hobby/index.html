                Hi my name is Edgar and this website is dedicated to my precious hobby and car. I am a car fanatic and have the pleasure of 
                owning the cute and popular Mazda Miata. With its convertible top and rear wheel drive setup, it's a car for hot girl summer
                and burning rubber in an empty parking lot. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Not only do I have a remarkable car, I have put blood, sweat and tears in the making it. Yes, I am able to do mechanic work, 
                or dare I say that I am a mechanic. I've been working on cars since I was 17 and can confidently do just about anything on my
                car, and a little less on other vehicles. 
            </p>

            </figure>
            <p>The Tail of the Dragon is considered one of the most dangerous road in Amercia. With 318 curves in 11 miles, this road has taken the lives
                of many drivers and motorcyclist alike, and it was exactly where my friends and I were at. Here we were at the very top, the halfway point 
                of the trail enjoying the scenery before taking on the rest of the road. We may or may not have been going over the speed limit the entire way.

            </figure>
            <p>After about a year and a half of owning the car, I had to replacet the clutch on my vehicle. This was the biggest job I had done so far 
                as it meant that I had to drop the entire transmission outside of the vehicle. Luckily, everything went mostly smoothly and the car
                is still running and driving (so far).

            <p>After receiving my tax returns two weeks prior, I had the unfortunate event of getting in an accident. While the other car was responsible for causing it, the driver had tried to switch into the lane I was in, I 
                had to pay it out of pocket. Worst part was, fighting the insurance company would have resulted in a bigger loss than gain.
