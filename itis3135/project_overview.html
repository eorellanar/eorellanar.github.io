        <h3>Proposal</h3>
        <p class="left-align">
            The website goal is to inform users about the basics and principles of JavaScript. We will go over
            datatypes, variables, functions, and conditional statements just to name a few. This website is meant
            for anyone who is first hearing about JavaScript and wants to learn more about it. Within our pages
            you'll find the basics of how to get started, coding examples, and some intermediate concepts about 
            JavaScript.  
        </p>
